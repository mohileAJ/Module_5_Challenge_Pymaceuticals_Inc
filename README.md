Pymaceuticals Inc. Analysis: 

Summary: 
Based on the results of the study covering 248 mice (one mouse observations were dropped due to non-unique timepoints' data, thereby reducing the number of datapoints from 1,893 to 1,880), the key takeaways from the clinical study are as follows: 
 
Capomulin and Ramicane had comparable statistics, in terms of the tumor size measurements.  For e.g., in terms of the mean (40.68 for Capomulin; 40.22 for Ramicane), median (41.56 for Capomulin; 40.67 for Ramicane), variance (24.95 for Capomulin; 23.49 for Ramicane), standard deviation (4.995 for Capomulin; 4.85 for Ramicane) and SEM (0.33 for Capomulin; 0.32 for Ramicane), the two drugs were the most effective treatments. 

Capomulin and Ramicane also had a similar positive effect of reducing the Tumor Volume, while Ceftamin and Infubinol had no effect on the tumor volume (this could be determined by using the min() function in the first cell in the Jupyter Notebook under the heading "Quartiles, Outliers and Boxplots"). The two drugs, Capomulin and Ramicane, showed superlative performance over a larger dataset compared to that of the other drug regimens. 

Incidentally, Infubinol had an observation, which albeit being an outlier,  wherein the tumor size in the mouse reduced to 36.32 mm3 compared to the 40 mm3 mean level of Capomulin and Ramicane.  

The treatment using Capomulin over a single mouse (l509) treatment seems to start showing a beneficial effect after the mid-timepoint, although there appears to be a relapse at 27 days and 36 days (based on eye-balling the "Capomulin treatment of mouse l509" chart). 

With reference to the mice undergoing Capomulin treatment, the distribution of the mice weight vs the average tumor volume is strongly correlated (correlation coefficient of 0.84), and is a linear relationship.  In fact, the weight of the mice and the tumor volume are almost proportionally related at a 0.95 : 1.00 ratio (given that the slope is 0.95).    

Based on the aforesaid study results, we could draw the following inferences:
1. Capomulin treatment, along with Ramicane, has a strong performance compared to the other treatment regimens, based on the statistics related to reduction of tumor volume measurements; 
2. The dataset for Capomulin and Ramicane comprised of a larger dataset and demonstrated consistent performance.  Based on the boxplots, Ramicane had a lower upper-bound and lower-bound dataset, indicating slightly better performance than that of Capomulin;  
3. The Capomulin treatment of a single mouse ("l509"), shows the effectiveness of Capomulin in reducing the tumor volume over the 45-days period; and 
4. That said, the correlation coefficient and the linear regression model conclusively show a strong correlation between the average tumor volume and the mouse's weight. 
Given that the tumor volumes are dependent variables of the mice weight, we may be able to draw further insights (in addition to those from overall statistics of the datasets) from visualizations that are specific to a single mouse's treatment, such as that of the single mouse, l509.
